Isi Deskripsi (Body Text):

<!-- CISCO -->

"This portfolio showcase represents my Superlab Project, where I designed and simulated an enterprise-grade network topology. The objective was to create a scalable and secure network architecture mimicking real-world ISP conditions.

Key Technical Implementations:

- Dynamic Routing: Configured OSPF Multi-Area (Backbone, Area 1, Area 2) to optimize routing tables and traffic flow.

- Advanced Switching: Implemented VLAN Segmentation, VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol), and Inter-VLAN Routing to isolate department traffic.

- Network Scalability: Designed a topology capable of handling multiple subnets and interconnecting various router brands (MikroTik & Cisco Integration)."

"A compilation of my technical projects during vocational study and professional internship. This portfolio highlights my capability in Physical Infrastructure:

Panel Assembly: Wiring and troubleshooting LVMDP/SDP panels and Motor Control Centers (Star-Delta/DOL).

Automation: Designing logic for Electro-Pneumatic systems using PLC (Programmable Logic Controller).

Maintenance: Diagnosing electrical faults and ensuring safety compliance in industrial environments."





<!-- AI -->

"Beyond technical engineering, I explore digital creativity to communicate ideas visually. This portfolio demonstrates my self-taught journey in integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into design workflows.

Branding & Commercial: Creating logos and product mockups (like the 'Altair' bottle) using advanced prompt engineering.

Visual Communication: Designing clear and attractive layouts for menus and posters.

Educational Content: Designing professional book covers for technical documentation, such as my network engineering guide 'Zero to Hero'."
